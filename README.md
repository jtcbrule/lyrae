# lyrae

Design: Clojure data structures -> Vega/Vegalite object. Record type / map.

Rendering converts it to a div block, and loads the necessary javascript, if it hasn't been loaded before

Idea: If offline, call a single function serve-vega! which changes all the script urls to an appropriate localhost? Options for custom url for vega javascript?

Alternative idea: Create a Jupyter extension that serves the vega js.
